# Img2XL

Img2XL is a Python 3 app that takes an image (`*.png` or `*.jpg`), and 'renders' it in Excel, so that each pixel in the image corresponds with one cell in Excel. Each cell is set the the color of the corresponding pixel. Behavior is undefined if output size is more than 300x300 cells/pixels. 

## Origin Code

It is based on <https://gist.github.com/CoconutMacaroon/963fa93e7f4eb200798f3ad50c07e612.> It uses mostly the same code as the Gist, but it wraps it in a GUI, and makes a few other minor changes.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `Img2XL.py` with Python 3.
